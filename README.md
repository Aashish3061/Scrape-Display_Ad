# Scrape-Display_Ad
This is a project to scrape display ads from webpages.
You will need to import the following for smooth execution of this program :
-Selenium
-Webdriver(as per your preference)
-BeautifulSoup
-time
-pandas

To change the webpages, replace the lik present in the "browser.get()" function with the url of the desired webpage. This particular scraping tool was specifically designed on a particular website and as the HTML structure of different websites may vary, some slight chages and modifications may need to be done for smooth execution of the program. The program uses both Selenium and BeautifulSoup to navigate through and parse the HTML structure of the webpage and to extract required information. The code is self-explanatory and executable. 
Thank You.
